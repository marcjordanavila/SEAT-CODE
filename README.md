# SEAT-CODE challenge

Technical Challenge
for SEAT:CODE Frontend Developer
Welcome!

If you are reading this document, thanks for the effort invested so far. We feel you can be a great member of our family. We want to learn a bit from your technical background to carry on with the process.
Instructions
Problem

You will be facing a Kata alike problem. It’s a code challenge small enough so it can be solved without investing too much time, but complex enough to give us some hints on your thinking process, problem-solving, testing, and software engineering skills.
Timing

The code challenge should take you around 4 hours. Feel free to invest more if you want to, but we understand that your time is a precious asset. We ask you to deliver your solution maximum 48 hours after you have received the challenge. So we can speed up the process and improve your candidate experience.
How to delivery the Code Challenge

Our preferred method of delivery is using GitHub. GitHub supports personal private projects, so it won’t cost you any pence. We have created a Fake Kent Beck GitHub account (@kent-beck) who you will have to invite as a collaborator. If you don’t know how to do it, take a look at “Inviting collaborators to a personal repository” Github Documentation Page. If for some reason you cannot use GitHub, you can zip your code challenge and send it to candidates@code.seat. Kent Beck won’t be as happy, but it will do the trick. Send us also an email in case of any issue with the delivery.
Last words

If you have any tech questions related to the challenge, take an assumption, and carry on. Please provide a small README file on how to compile and run your application. Best of luck! We hope you enjoy the code challenge!
